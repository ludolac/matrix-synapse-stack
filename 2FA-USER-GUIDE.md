## What is Two-Factor Authentication?

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), also known as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), adds an extra layer of security to your Matrix account. Instead of just entering your password to log in, you'll also need to provide a 6-digit code from an authenticator app on your phone.

### How it works:
1. **Something you know**: Your password
2. **Something you have**: Your phone with the authenticator app

Even if someone steals your password, they won't be able to access your account without the 6-digit code from your phone.

## Why Enable 2FA?

‚úÖ **Protect your account** from unauthorized access
‚úÖ **Prevent password theft** - stolen passwords alone won't work
‚úÖ **Secure your conversations** - keeps your messages private
‚úÖ **Meet security requirements** - some organizations require 2FA
‚úÖ **Industry standard** - used by banks, email providers, and social media

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Invalid code" error

**Causes & Solutions**:

1. **Time synchronization issue**
   - Your phone's time is incorrect
   - **Fix**: Enable "Automatic date & time" in phone settings
   - iOS: Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Date & Time ‚Üí Set Automatically
   - Android: Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Date & time ‚Üí Use network-provided time

2. **Code expired**
   - Codes change every 30 seconds
   - **Fix**: Wait for the next code to appear

3. **Wrong account**
   - You might have multiple Matrix accounts in your app
   - **Fix**: Make sure you're using the code from the correct account

### Problem: Lost phone / Can't access authenticator app

**Solution**: Use a recovery code
1. Click **Use recovery code** at login
2. Enter one of your saved recovery codes
3. Log in successfully
4. **Immediately** set up 2FA again with a new device

### Problem: Lost recovery codes

**If you can still log in**:
1. Log in to Element Web
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Security & Privacy
3. Generate new recovery codes
4. Save them securely

**If you cannot log in**:
- Contact your Matrix administrator
- Email: admin@waadoo.ovh
- They can disable 2FA for your account

### Problem: QR code won't scan

**Solutions**:
1. **Manual entry**: Click "Can't scan?" and enter the code manually
2. **Adjust brightness**: Make your screen brighter
3. **Try different app**: Some authenticator apps scan better than others
4. **Clean camera**: Make sure your phone camera lens is clean

### Problem: Codes don't work for SSO login

**Note**: If you use SSO (Single Sign-On) with Authelia:
- 2FA should be configured in Authelia, not in Element
- Contact your administrator about Authelia 2FA setup

## Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- **Enable 2FA immediately** for admin accounts
- **Use a reputable authenticator app** from the list above
- **Save recovery codes** in a password manager
- **Enable automatic time sync** on your phone
- **Set up 2FA on multiple devices** (if your app supports it)
- **Keep your authenticator app updated**

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- **Don't share your 6-digit codes** with anyone
- **Don't email or text** recovery codes to yourself
- **Don't take screenshots** of QR codes (unless encrypted)
- **Don't use SMS-based 2FA** if TOTP is available (TOTP is more secure)
- **Don't disable 2FA** unless absolutely necessary

### üîê Extra Security:
1. **Use a password manager** to generate strong passwords
2. **Use different passwords** for different services
3. **Enable 2FA on your email** (protects password reset)
4. **Consider a hardware key** (YubiKey) for maximum security
